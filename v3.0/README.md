# Delineation-Tool
This reposiory contains contains source code and guidanceto apply our semi-automatic indirect surveying approach for cadastral mapping from remote sensing data. We advise to use the latest version (v3.0) only:

https://github.com/its4land/delineation-tool/tree/master/v3.0

### Workflow
The delineation tool consists of three steps:
  (i) image segmentation to extract visible object outlines 
  (ii) boundary classification to predict boundary likelihoods for extracted segment lines, and 
  (iii) interactive delineation to connect these lines based on the predicted boundary likelihood.

### Usage
Our wiki provides detailed guidance on how to apply each workflow step:
